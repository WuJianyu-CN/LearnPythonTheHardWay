# A Project Skeleton
## Linux Setup

```
pip list
  sudo pip3 install virtualenv

  ➜  ex41-50 git:(master) ✗ whereis virtualenv
virtualenv: /usr/local/bin/virtualenv
```
**Once you've installed virtualenv you can use it to create a "fake" Python installation, which makes it easier to manage versions of your packages for different projects.**
```
    mkdir ~/.venvs
    virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/.venvs/lpthw
    . ~/.venvs/lpthw/bin/activate

```
Here's what's going on line by line:
    1. You create a directory called .venvs in your HOME ~/ to store all your virtual environments.
    2. You run virtualenv and tell it to include the system site packages (--system-site-packages), then instruct it to build the virtualenv in ~/.venvs/lpthw.
    3. You then "source" the lpthw virtual environment by using the . operator in bash, followed by the ~/.venvs/lpthw/bin/activate script.
    4. Finally, your prompt changes to include (lpthw), so you know that you're using that virtual environment.

*Where things are installed:*
```
(lpthw) ➜  ~ which python
/home/jay/.venvs/lpthw/bin/python
(lpthw) ➜  ~ python
Python 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17)
[GCC 8.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
(lpthw) ➜  ~ which python3.6
/home/jay/.venvs/lpthw/bin/python3.6


```
**The final step in this setup is to install nose, a testing framework we'll use in this exerice:**

```
p3 install nose

## Creating the Skeleton Project Directory

- Fisrt, create the structure of your skeleton directory with these commands:
```
➜  python_test git:(master) ✗ mkdir projects
➜  python_test git:(master) ✗ cd projects
➜  projects git:(master) ✗ mkdir skeleton
➜  projects git:(master) ✗ cd skeleton
➜  skeleton git:(master) ✗ mkdir bin NAME tests docs
```
The directory **NAME** will be renamed to whatever you are calling your project's main module when you use the skeleton.

* Next, we need to set up some initial files. Here's how you do that on Linux:
```
➜  skeleton git:(master) ✗ touch NAME/__init__.py
➜  skeleton git:(master) ✗ touch tests/__init__.py
```
That creates an empty Python module directory we can put our code in. Then we need to create a setup.py file we can use to install our project later if we want:
```
try:
    from setuptools import setup
except ImportError:
    from distutils.core import setup

config = {
    'description': 'My Project',
    'author': 'My Name',
    'url': 'URL to get it at.'
    'download_url': 'Where to download it.',
    'author_email': 'My email.',
    'version': '0.1',
    'install_requrires': ['nose'],
    'packages': ['NAME'],
    'scripts': [],
    'name': 'projectname'
}

set(**config)
```

* Finally, you will want a simple skeleton file for tests named tests/NAME_tests.py
```
from nose.tools import *
import NAME

def setup():
    prin("SETUP!")

def teardown():
    print("TEAR DOWN!")

def test_basic():
    print("I RAN!")
```
* Run the script under the CORRECT directory, here is the file structure

```
➜  skeleton git:(master) ✗ ls -R
.:
bin  docs  NAME  setup.py  tests

./bin:

./docs:

./NAME:
__init__.py  __pycache__

./NAME/__pycache__:
__init__.cpython-36.pyc

./tests:
__init__.py  NAME_tests.py  NAME_tests.py~  __pycache__

./tests/__pycache__:
__init__.cpython-36.pyc  NAME_tests.cpython-36.pyc

➜  skeleton git:(master) ✗ nosetests
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.003s

OK

```
Make sure you put \_\_init__.py files in your NAME and tests directories, and make sure you got tests/NAME_tests.py right

## Using the Skeleton

You are now done with most of your yak shaving. Whenever you want to start a new project, just do this:
1. Make a copy of your skeleton directory. Name it after your new project.
2. Rename(move the NAME) directory to be the name of your project or whatever you want to call your root module.
3. Edit your setup.py to have all the information for your project.
4. Rename tests/NAME_test.py to also have your module name.
5. Double check it's all working by using nosetests again.
6. Start coding.
